    <p> To Swordsman Sensei Weeb,
        (Always read this whenever you feel ....
        And confidently remember these words) </p>


    <p> ﮩ٨ـﮩﮩ٨ـ♡ﮩ٨ـﮩﮩ٨ </p>  
    
    <p> It might be impossible but.. The more i know you, the more i try to think of what it is in you I won't find beautiful.
        Everything you do is wonderful that there's no other word left for me to say ♡ ´･ᴗ･ `♡ Mmm maybe because small gestures show their own unique charm.
        And your simple gestures makes me smile :)) This means you surely have great charms in you and you just don't know how to let them show.  
        I'm sure you're someone who's cooler than anyone else weeb (^^*) Soo now, be more confident.
        I mean, you can be a bit more proud. Don't deliberately belittle yourself ... 
        Someone might clearly be feeling sad when you're in pain, 
        and others might have recognized your charms and have already fallen for you :D </p>

    
    <p> So all you have to do in there is just bloom like a flower. I know you are clearly someone of great value weeb ;)
        You're someone who's strong and so you'll do a good job, someone with great charm that moves people's heart, so you really deserve to be happy. 
        Weeb-Arin always got your back and genuinely care for you :)) Weeb-Tep have his own unique color, and so will definitely paint a more beautiful life than anyone else ♡
        Follow your heart. Nothing is impossible for you .. Whatever it is, follow your heart and even if you find yourself with regret, you will also feel proud weeb.
        (A tip from a self proclaimed pro :'3 ) .... People might say u have to take your mind off ur worries 
        but i know it's harder than putting down an umbrella on a rainy day. So I won't force you to try too hard to do the same,
        but please don't be in so much pain ok?? </p>

    <p> I'm worried that you'll blame yourself for feeling your day was meaningless. </p>
    <p> I wish you'll understand this one thing: </p>

    <p> Even if you achieved nothing, you must have done your best and offered so much of you. </p>
    <p> These days, although the world now cares not about the tiring process but only the result, people who recognize the precious process you had to go through definitely exist. 
        There are those who worry about you feeling daunted but still believe how amazing you are, and I'm one of them. </p>

    <p> So, hang in there weeb. Not a single moment in your life is meaningless. Every moment I spend with you is meaningful. 
        I wish you'd be sincerely happy. And like what I said, I hope you feel it "in a sincere way."
        Not because of being able to do many things, but by feeling a happiness so genuine, your smile comes from the heart. ^^
        I have once seen your smile, i wish you could smile more through these simple life moments that you may have forgotten.. 
        Because you have the most gorgeous smile in the world, and you are the one I care for the most. </p>

    <p> We still have more time so i hope that we should still create many memories 
        and achieve the things we want together weeb ^^ </p>
