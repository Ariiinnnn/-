    <p> It might be impossible but.. The more i know you, the more i try to think of what it is in you I won't find beautiful. 
    <p> Everything you do is wonderful that there's no other word left for me to say ♡ ´･ᴗ･ `♡ </p>
    <p> Mmm maybe because small gestures show their own unique charm. And your simple gestures makes me smile :)) This means you surely have great-</p>
    <p> charms in you and you just don't know how to let them show. I'm sure you're someone who's cooler than anyone else weeb (^^*)</p>
    <p> Soo now, be more confident. I mean, you can be a bit more proud. Don't deliberately belittle yourself ...</p>
    <p> Someone might clearly be feeling sad when you're in pain, </p> 
    <p> and others might have recognized your charms and have already fallen for you :D </p>

<br>
<br>
    
<p> So all you have to do in there is just bloom like a flower. I know you are clearly someone of great value weeb ;)</p>
     <p> You're someone who's strong and so you'll do a good job, someone with great charm that moves people's heart, so you really deserve to be happy.</p> 
      <p> Weeb-Arin always got your back and genuinely care for you :)) Weeb-Tep have his own unique color, and so will definitely paint</p>
       <p> a more beautiful life than anyone else ♡ Follow your heart. Nothing is impossible for you ..</p>
        <p> Whatever it is, follow your heart and even if you find yourself with regret, you will also feel proud weeb.</p>
        <p> -(A tip from a self proclaimed pro :'3 ) .... People might say u have to take your mind off ur worries </p>
       <p> but i know it's harder than putting down an umbrella on a rainy day. So I won't force you to try too hard to do the same,</p>
       <p> but please don't be in so much pain ok?? </p> </p>

<br>
<br>

    <p> I'm worried that you'll blame yourself for feeling your day was meaningless. </p>
    <p><h4> I wish you'll understand this one thing:</h4></p>
<br>
    <p> Even if you achieved nothing, you must have done your best and offered so much of you. </p>
    <p> These days, although the world now cares not about the tiring process but only the result, </p>
    <p> people who recognize the precious process you had to go through definitely exist.</p>
      <p> There are those who worry about you feeling daunted but still believe how amazing you are, and I'm one of them. </p>

<br>
<br>

    <p> So, hang in there weeb. Not a single moment in your life is meaningless. Every moment I spend with you is meaningful.</p> 
      <p>  I wish you'd be sincerely happy. And like what I said, I hope you feel it "in a sincere way."</p>
       <p> Not because of being able to do many things, but by feeling a happiness so genuine, your smile comes from the heart. ^^</p>
       <p> I have once seen your smile, i wish you could smile more through these simple life moments that you may have forgotten.. </p>
       <p> Because you have the most gorgeous smile in the world, and you are the one I care for the most. </p>

<br>

    <p> We still have more time so i hope that we should still create many memories </p>
      <p> and achieve the things we want together weeb ^^ </p>
